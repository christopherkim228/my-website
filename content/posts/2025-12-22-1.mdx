## 1.1 Mathematical Induction
<Theorem title="Well-Ordering Principle">
Every nonempty set $S$ of nonnegative integers contains a least element; that is, there is some integer $a$ in $S$ such that $a <= b$ for all $b$s belonging to $S$.
</Theorem>

<Theorem title="Theorem 1.1 Archimedean Property">
If $a$ and $b$ are any positive integers, then there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $na >= b$.
</Theorem>

<Proof title="Proof to Theorem 1.1">
Assume $\exist a, b \in \mathbb{N} \ \text{s.t.} \ na < b$.  
Then, $S=\{b-na \mid n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ has a least element, $b-ma$, by the Well-Ordering Principle.  
However, $b-(m+1)a < S$, and $b-(m+1)a = b - ma - m < b - ma$, so $b-ma$ is not the least element fo $S$. Since a contradiction arises, original statement is true.
</Proof>

<Theorem title="Theorem 1.2 First Principle of Finite Induction">
Let $S$ be a set of positive integers with the following properties:  

(a) The integer 1 belongs to $S$.  
(b) Whenever the integer $k$ is in $S$, the next integer $k+1$ must also be in $S$.  

Then $S$ is the set of all positive integers.
</Theorem>

<Proof title="Proof to Theorem 1.2">
Proof by contradiction. Let $T$ be the set of all positive integers not in $S$, and assume that $T$ is nonempty. By the Well-Ordering Principle, there must be a least element $m$ to this set. By (a), $m > 1$, so $0 < m - 1 < m$. Because $m-1$ is a positive integer and is not in $T$, it must be in $S$. But by (b), $(m-1)+1=m$ must be in $S$. This leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the original statement is true.
</Proof>

**Remark** When giving induction proofs, we usually eliminate all references to the set $S$, and simply show that results holds for $1$, and if true for $k$, then also true for $k+1$.  

When doing induction proofs, (a) is usually called the **basis step**, and (b) is called the **induction step**.  

<Theorem title="Second Principle of Finite Induction">
Let $S$ be a set of positive integers with the following properties:  

(a) The integer 1 belongs to $S$.  
(b') If $k$ is a positive integer such that 1, 2, ... $k$ belong to $S$, then $k+1$ must also be in $S$.

Then $S$ is the set of all positive integers.
</Theorem>

<Proof title="Proof to the Second Principle of Finite Induction">
Proof by contradiction. Let $T$ be the set of all positive integers not in $S$, and assume that $T$ is nonempty. By the Well-Ordering Principle, there must be a least element $m$ to this set. By (a), $m > 1$, so 1, 2, ..., $m-1$ all lie in S. But by (b), $(m-1)+1=m$ must be in $S$. This leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the original statement is true.
</Proof>

## 1.2 Binomial Theorem
**Binomial Coefficients** - $\binom{n}{k}$
$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!}
$$

**Pascal's Rule**
$$
\binom{n}{k} + \binom{n}{k-1} = \binom{n+1}{k}
$$

**Pascal's Triangle**
$$
\begin{array}{ccccccccccccccc}
&&&&& 1 && 1 \\
&&&& 1 && 2 && 1 \\
&&& 1 && 3 && 3 && 1 \\
&& 1 && 4 && 6 && 4 && 1 \\
& 1 && 5 && 10 && 10 && 5 && 1 \\
1 && 6 && 15 && 20 && 15 && 6 && 1 \\
&&&&&& \vdots
\end{array}
$$

<Theorem title="Binomial Theorem">
$$
(a+b)^n=\sum_{k=0}^{n}{\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k}
$$
</Theorem>

<Proof title="Proof to Binomial Theorem">
Proof by induction.  
Basis step: $n=1$
$$
(a+b)^1 = \sum^{1}_{k=0}{a^{1-k}b^k}=\binom10a^1b^0+\binom11a^0b^1=a+b
$$

Induction step: Assume formula holds for $m$. For $m+1$
$$
(a+b)^{m+1}=a(a+b)^m+b(a+b)^m \\
\begin{align*}
a(a+b)^m&=\sum^{m}_{k=0}{\binom{m}{k}a^{m-k+1}b^k} \\
&= a^{m+1} + \sum^{m}_{k=1}{\binom{m}{k}a^{m+1-k}b^k} \\
b(a+b)^m&=\sum^{m}_{j=0}{\binom{m}{j}a^{m-j}b^{j+1}} \\
&= \sum^{m}_{k=1}{\binom{m}{k-1}a^{m+1-k}b^k + b^{m+1}}
\end{align*} \\
\begin{align*}
(a+b)^{m+1}&=a^{m+1} + \sum^{m}_{k=1}{\left[\binom{m}{k}+\binom{m}{k-1}\right]a^{m+1-k}b^k} + b^{m+1} \\
&=\sum^{m+1}_{k=0}{\binom{m+1}{k}a^{m+1-k}b^k}
\end{align*}
$$
</Proof>
